**Focus:** Fix healer regression reported after 0.3.16 while continuing M1 reference-aware lifecycle work
**Updated:** 2026-09-28

## In flight

Version 0.3.16 updates the web README and in-game title. This release includes
the current M1 source work plus the Fusion comparison, healing visibility, and
completed-run gear progression changes. M1 editor/export acceptance remains
open and no Godot process or test suite was run for this release.

Post-release report: heals stopped resolving and the healer animation looked
wrong. The connected editor log showed zero frames from both authored healer
sheets; those two PNGs were the only artwork files missing `.import` metadata.
They now have import metadata and static dependencies. Empty animation sets
fall back to actor frames, release timing waits through heal impact, and the
healer arc endpoint crosshair is removed. MCP script diagnostics pass for the
three changed scripts; no gameplay or test suite was run. Web playtest evidence
remains open.

This M1 step closes the enemy registry validator's duplicate-ID blind spot:
the catalog now validates every distinct embedded and standalone source before
runtime lookup deduplicates by stable ID, and duplicate diagnostics name both
paths. The authoring dock exposes the same catalog check as `Validate Enemies`
and labels placement-only validation `Validate Scene`. Offline `script_check`
and `git diff --check` pass. No tests or Godot runtime checks were run.

The deterministic manifest service, CLI, dock refresh, generated all-resource
and kind-specific manifests, and preflight integration are in place locally.
Offline GDScript and PowerShell parser checks pass; a static comparison confirms
the checked-in manifests cover all 28 resources. Godot-side generation,
preflight execution, and lifecycle/export proof remain open. No Godot process
may be launched in this session.

The 2026-09-28 follow-up audit found that Fusion inherited Shop's `EQUIP`/`ITEM`
labels at y=46 despite Fusion's stat rows beginning at y=41, and compared the
pre-fusion item against its projected upgrade. The Fusion/healer interlude is
now implemented locally. Fusion uses Shop's
equipped-piece versus selected-item comparison (with mastery bonuses and the
same value colors) and moves both headers to y=33 above Fusion's y=41 stat rows.
Healing uses a cached 9x9 high-contrast pixel plus and leaves the 3x5 text glyph
untouched. `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, the menu presentation contract, tuning index, and
healer plan now record the findings and current source behavior. Offline
`script_check` passes for the three changed scripts and `git diff --check`
passes. No tests or Godot runtime checks were run.

Gear rewards now add progression from saved `completed_runs` only; current-run
room depth does not enter the new curves. Chests use the previous clear count,
while clear rewards include the run being completed. Chest chance and extra-item
thresholds progress to their 20-run cap; clear chance adds 0.25 percentage
points per completed run and can reach 100% at maximum score after 20 runs;
rarity adds 0.005 total rare-or-better probability per run, capped at 0.10.
Offline script diagnostics pass for RewardDefinition, ItemCatalog, and
RunFlowController; all 37 exported reward fields have explicit `.tres` values,
and `git diff --check` passes. No tests or Godot runtime checks were run.
No Godot process may be launched in this session.

Enemy and item runtime discovery now filters typed resources from separate
generated manifests, so each catalog loads only its own authored resource set.
The kind manifests are static export dependencies; editor loads replace each
cached manifest after refresh. The dock coalesces save, reimport, and filesystem
change events, then invalidates enemy and item definition caches. Offline
diagnostics pass for the plugin, dock, both catalog data scripts, and manifest
service; static comparison confirms 28 resources, 10 standalone enemies, and 2
items. Exported loading and create/move/delete acceptance remain open.

## Blockers

Do not launch another Godot process in this session after the recorded startup
stall and standalone crash. The authoring-dock and PreviewSession contract
smokes, editor save/reimport/undo behavior, isolated profile/settings behavior,
and rendered acceptance remain unverified.

Preserve the existing `.mcp.json` and `docs/timed-floor-hazard-plan.md`
changes. Do not stage them with M1.

## Handoff / next

Continue M1 with reference-aware content create/duplicate/move/delete, preview
revision and stale-state reporting, and the export/lifecycle proof. Keep the
create/edit/duplicate/move/delete/undo/reimport/restart acceptance open until
the connected editor can verify it. The recorded Godot process restriction
still applies; when the environment is safe, run the registered authoring-dock
and PreviewSession smokes plus the definition validator and editor-side
isolation checks.
